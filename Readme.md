## Next Level Week

The NLW was a week of intensive coding and learning offered by Rocketseat focused on web development, using technologies such as React, Node and TypeScript.

During the week, a project was developed, divided in 5 classes, from start to finish, to study concepts that usually are demanded by the market, such as REST, app development and database integration.

## About The Project

The project is called **Ecoleta**, a platform to search collecting points for different kinds of residues. There is a webapp, that is used exclusively to register these points, and there is a mobile app, so that the final user can search for the points.

The applications consume the back-end, also developed during the week, to register and search for the collecting points.
